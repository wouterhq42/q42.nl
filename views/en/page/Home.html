          <h2>Jumpstarts &amp; (Ad)ventures</h2>
          <p>During a jumpstart, we'll work with you to flesh out an idea in one week, with a high quality team. When we feel a jumpstart has the power to leave a mark, we may invest in the idea. Ideas we've invested in include our own products, games, and experiments.</p>
          <p>We've done jumpstarts for companies including Shell, Taxi Electric, Umuntu Media, Nannii, Spinn Coffee and Swisscom.</p>
