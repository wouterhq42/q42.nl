# Q42.nl & Q42.com [![Link](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/https/www.q42.com.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.q42.com) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/nerds-happy-brightgreen.svg)

We've published the source code to [q42.nl](https://q42.nl) and
[q42.com](https://q42.com) here for your perusal.

If you find anything on our site that you feel needs fixing, be it code,
spelling or anything else, don't hesitate to send us a pull request or create
an issue. We maintain the site ourselves with the same workflow.

The site is built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

## Configure your editor

Make sure your editor has support for .editorconfig, and .jshintrc.

## Add settings you need

Create a `config/dev/settings.json` file containing the correct Tumblr and
Kadira account information:

```
{
	"public": {
		"siteVersion": "nl", // or "en" to develop the .com site
		"TUMBLR_KEY": "..."
	},
	"private": {
		"chatConfig": {
			"incomingUrl": "INCOMING_SLACK_HOOK_URL",
			"outgoingToken": "OUTGOING_SLACK_TOKEN"
		},
		"serviceConfiguration": [
			{ ... }
		]
		"MONGO_URL": "...",
		"MONGO_OPLOG_URL": "..."
	},
	"kadira": {
		"appId": "...",
		"appSecret": "..."
	}
}
```

The Tumblr key is required for the blog to not explode (even though you won't
actually be able to see any posts without our real API key). If you misconfigure
Kadira, you'll just get console errors. You can get a hold of the keys in the
"q42.nl" vault in 1Password.

(if you use the config file as above, without actual values, the site will still
	run, but without blog, and with warnings/errors).

## Running the site locally

	meteor --settings config/dev/settings.json

Or use this script so you don't have to remember the above:

	./run.sh

# Deploying to Galaxy

You need the following prerequisites:

 - `config/q42.nl/settings.json` and `config/q42.com/settings.json` based on the
   above template. In the '.com' version, be sure to set siteVersion to 'en'.
	 Make sure _all_ fields are configured.
 - Git Flow, which you can get here:
	 https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation -- note you'll need to
	 `git flow init` while on the `develop` branch, as the git flow state isn't
	 checked in to the repository. At init time, choose 'master' for production
	 releases and 'develop' for next release (the defaults). Choose the defaults
	 for all others too (feature/, release/, hotfix/, support/, empty).
 - `gcloud` command line tool, from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/. Install,
 	 then authenticate using `gcloud auth login`.
 - Access to the static.q42.nl GCS bucket via
   https://console.developers.google.com/project/504623166341/storage/browser.
   Ask Rahul or Lukas.

Since you need to deploy to two separate sites (q42.nl and q42.com), there's a
script which will take care of both commands. Just run:

	./deploy-galaxy.sh

# Contributing

Content for the site is located in the /views folder as regular .html files, so
if you want to edit some content, just navigate to that file and edit it! A
really fast way to clean up spelling mistakes and similar small problems is to
just load the repository on Github and use its built-in editor to edit files.
Github will automatically fork the project for you and submit a pull request.
